# Swiftly-Managers-Special
A code challenge for Swiftly

# Description
This project can be used to fetch special offers from an endpoint and then display them in a stacked view.  This stacked view will automatically place the views next to each other, filling a row and then placing any overflowing views in the next row, similar to a UICollectionView.

# Installation
To run this project, clone the repository to your PC and open the `ManagersSpecial.xcodeproj` in Xcode.  Configure any codesigning errors and then click run to see the application run on a simulator or connected device.

# Support
